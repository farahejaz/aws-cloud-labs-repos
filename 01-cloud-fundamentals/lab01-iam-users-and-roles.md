# 🌩️ Lab 01 – IAM Users and Roles

**Module:** 01 – Cloud Fundamentals  
**Author:** Farah Ejaz  
**Goal:** Learn how to manage user access and permissions in AWS using the **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** service.

---

## 🎯 Objective
By the end of this lab, you will be able to:
- Create a new IAM user with programmatic access.
- Assign permissions using AWS managed policies.
- Understand IAM roles and their use cases.
- Test access by logging in as the IAM user.

---

## 🧩 Prerequisites
- AWS Free Tier Account
- Access to AWS Management Console
- Basic understanding of users and permissions

---

## 🪜 Step-by-Step Instructions

### **Step 1 – Sign in to AWS Console**
1. Visit [https://aws.amazon.com/console/](https://aws.amazon.com/console/)
2. Sign in using your root or admin account.

---

### **Step 2 – Open IAM Service**
1. In the search bar, type **IAM** and open the service.
2. You’ll land on the **IAM Dashboard**.

---

### **Step 3 – Create a New User**
1. Click **Users → Create User**.  
2. Enter username: `labuser01`  
3. Check **Provide user access to the AWS Management Console**.  
4. Choose **Autogenerated password** and note it down.  
5. (Optional) Uncheck “Require password reset” if you’re just testing.

### **Step 4 – Assign Permissions**
1. Under **Set Permissions**, choose **Attach policies directly**.
2. Search for and select **AdministratorAccess**.
3. Click **Next → Create User**.

✅ *You’ve created your first IAM user.*

---

### **Step 5 – Test the User**
1. Copy the **IAM user sign-in URL** shown on the success page.
2. Sign out from your root account.
3. Paste the copied URL and sign in as `labuser01`.
4. Explore the console to verify access.

---

### **Step 6 – Create and Assign IAM Role (optional)**
1. Go back to the **IAM Dashboard**.
2. Click **Roles → Create role**.
3. Choose **AWS Service → EC2 → Next**.
4. Attach **AmazonS3FullAccess**.
5. Name it `EC2S3AccessRole`.
6. Later, you can attach this role to an EC2 instance to give it access to S3.

## 🧠 Key Learnings
- IAM separates **identity (user/role)** and **access (policy)**.  
- Use **roles** for AWS services instead of embedding keys in your code.  
- Follow **Least Privilege Principle** — give only the access needed.
