# My AWS Portfolio

Hi, Iâ€™m Farah Ejaz! ðŸ‘‹  
Iâ€™m currently learning AWS and building small cloud projects.  

## Projects
- S3 Static Website â€” hosting a simple HTML site on S3
- Lambda Function â€” testing serverless functions
- EC2 Instance â€” running my first virtual server

Iâ€™ll update this repo as I learn more!
